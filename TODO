- Setting up column view widths is broken. This has changed significantly since gtk3. See posts:

  We currently use a Glib timeout ( every 200 ms ) to detect changes to the width of the scrolled window,
  but there *must* be a better way

--------

- We currently can't handle NULL values in data. To support this, we need to extend the generated GridRow
  class. We could either:

   1) Have another property to store the values INCLUDING the NULL state ( this would be None in python ) and
      marshall this property's value back to the on that's bound to the widgets. This is a bit awkward. But
      it's also probably the easiest :)

   2) We could potentially use gtk expressions?

   3) We could use https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/method.Object.bind_property_full.html - for Forms, but
      probably not for Datasheets?

  I've done some work on setting some custom CSS to highlight a widget - this works. Once we figure out
  modeling, we need to set this on widgets bound to a column that currently has a NULL value.
