The example_app.ui.cmb and example_app.ui files here were generated
using Cambalache - https://gitlab.gnome.org/jpu/cambalache

example_app.py is a simple example application and test-bed
for development. If a sqlite database doesn't exist, it's created
and populated with some demo data. Then 2 datasheets ( a customer
list and an address list ) and a form ( customer form ) are created.

The idea is you click a customer in the list to edit details for that
customer, ( ie in the form, which has further fields from the DB ).

Not everything is working yet - we haven't hit an initial release.
But we're close.
